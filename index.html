      My name is <a class="hackLink" href="about.html">Gerald</a> and I'm a Sophomore EECS major at UC Berkeley.
      This is a collection of what I've built during the past two years.

      We hijacked powerstrips and hooked it up to an arduino that talks via radio to another arduino connected to our laptop.
      We then built a node server to control power via arduino C and created an API on top of that. The result
      was a way to schedule, control, and monitor all electronics you are using including toasters, lights, and any other home appliance.

      We attached capaciator touch wires onto the inside of an oragami paper cube, and then used those sensors
      to pinpoint finger movmements nearby. We created a multi surface touch pad with advanced gestures that costed a few dollars.

      <p>
      We tracked the movements of a finger by putting reflective tape on it, and to collect Infrared Lights
      using a Wii Remote. We implemented the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm to figure out the letters being
      traced by the hand. We also created an interface to move the mouse around to point and click.
      </p>
      <p>
      The stack consisted largely of Java and swing to visualize the controls.

      The Splash Mobile App helps people efficiently and simply arrange hangouts and meetups
      without the hassle that many of the modern day systems have today. This was a summer project
      with a few of my classmates from high school.
      </p>
      <p>
      This application was built on a Java Servlet on a Jetty Server hosted in Amazon EC2.

      During my junior year of High School just after learning Data Structures and Object Oriented
      Programming (OOP), I led a team of three to create this aim and fire physics basics game.
      My groupmembers for the project were Aditya Majumdar, current Columbia Student, and Kevin Heh,
      a current Stanford student. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I designed the project which consisted of a life-like physics engine with randomly varying 
      graphics. The front end was built on the Javax Swing library. The project in total had over 30 
      images and 50 classes. We also implemented complex inheritence chains for items such as upgrades
      and additional weapons, or different missile types.
